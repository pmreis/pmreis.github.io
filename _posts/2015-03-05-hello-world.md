This is the year 2015; I started coding at the age of 12 way back in 1986; amazingly this is my first written blog post!

Fist things first! I'm Pedro, a Portuguese computer scientist and software engineer that never worried much about blogging... until now!

I hope to keep on doing this blogging stuff for some time and share with you some of my idiosyncrasies, thoughts and experiences on this thing called life. You can always start by checking out my short [biography](/about).
