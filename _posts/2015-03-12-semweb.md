It has been a while since the last practical tasks I had related with Semantic Web. Yesterday I've given a talk about it.

ISCTE-IUL and ACM are involved in the promotion of a series of events called the [Student Chapter](http://iscte.acm.org/). These events are free and focus on the subjects of science, technology and management.

Yesterday it was my turn to give a [talk](http://iscte.acm.org/event/unravelling-semantic-web/) about Semantic Web. For anyone interested in the presentation, it is available [here](https://github.com/pmreis/semweb).

I also provide a file with some federated SPARQL queries and settings required to run them on [Virtuoso](http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/).
